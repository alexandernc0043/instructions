                Your business name is your mascot - the animal you put in your introduction and on your websites (every
                title and h2). Make sure you&apos;re happy with it, and if not, change it in all locations NOW. Be sure the
                adjective has the same initial as your first name, and the creature the same letter as your last name.
                If either name has multiple words, pick one or be creative. (i.e D.I. von Briesen could be Dapper
                Indignant Viper or Dapper Viper or Diligent Indignant Voracious Baboon).
