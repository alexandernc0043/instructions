                <p>
                    Complete two peer reviews. Use the commenting feature in the Google
                    Doc (highlight text, right-click, comment) to suggest updates or
                    corrections so your classmates can fix typos or formatting issues.

                    We will give you 1 point for any errors/typos with feedback to correct
                    them. If there are still errors, it will be 1 more point, and so on
                    until itâ€™s about perfect. The closer to perfect you start, the better.

                <p>When posting to Canvas for this assignment, confirm that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You added your entry following the required formatting.</li>
                    <li>
                        Your name in the table of contents is listed as <em>Last, First</em>
                        and alphabetized by last name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your bullets are tidy with no extra spaces, and your nested course
                        list contains course names without sections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You have all seven links above, and each goes to your own accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You completed two peer reviews and briefly summarize who you
                        reviewed and what you suggested.

                <p>
                    In the Google Doc, go to your entry&apos;s heading (the H2 you created
                    with <em>Last, First</em>), copy the link to that heading, and submit
                    that URL in Canvas. We should be able to click it and jump directly to
                    your entry.
